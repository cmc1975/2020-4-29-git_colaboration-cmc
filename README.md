Git collaboration workshop

    - git clone <url>  : download the repositiory from the web to our computer
  	- Make sure you don't nest this command in another repository
	- just like git init  do this only once per repository

##  rebasing 

-git rebase <branch>  if b is mtr, replay will auto merge if possible 
-potentially deal with conflicts.
